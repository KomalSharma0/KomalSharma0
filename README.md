<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Komal Sharma</h1>
<h3 align="left">After graduating in 2020, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery, initially preparing for competitive exams. While this path didn’t unfold as planned, it led me to explore various career options. In 2023, during my research on potential careers, I stumbled upon Data Analytics, and it immediately resonated with me. The ability to derive meaningful insights from data and drive informed decision-making sparked my curiosity, and I knew I had found my calling.

While interviewing for jobs, I secured a role as a Customer Care Executive in the automotive industry. This experience strengthened my communication and problem-solving skills, but I soon realized it wasn’t aligned with my long-term aspirations. In late 2023, I made the bold decision to transition fully into Data Analytics.

To build a strong foundation, I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Analytics Certification Program, where I immersed myself in SQL (MySQL), Power BI, Python, and Advanced Excel. This journey not only sharpened my analytical thinking but also allowed me to transfer my problem-solving abilities from previous roles into the world of data.

Since then, I have actively worked on developing my practical skills through multiple job simulations on Forage and internships at 360DigiTMG, KultureHire, and Cognifyz Technologies. These experiences provided hands-on exposure to real-world data challenges, where I applied analytical techniques to uncover key insights, enhance operational efficiency, and optimize business processes. Each project has reinforced my passion for data-driven problem-solving and deepened my understanding of industry best practices.

Currently, I am continuously working on new projects to further refine my skills and stay up to date with evolving trends in Data Analytics.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where I showcase my ongoing projects and progress as a Data Analyst. I am always open to feedback and collaboration!</h3>
