<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Komal Sharma</h1>
<h3 align="center">After graduating in 2020, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery, initially preparing for competitive exams. While this path didnâ€™t work out as planned, it led me to explore different career options. In 2023, while researching career opportunities, I stumbled upon Data Analytics, which sparked my interest. The potential to derive insights from data and drive informed decision-making caught my attention, and I knew I had found my calling. While interviewing for jobs during this time, I secured a role as a Customer Care Executive in the automotive industry. Though this role honed my communication and problem-solving skills, I realized it wasnâ€™t aligned with my long-term career goals. In late 2023, I made a bold decision to quit and fully commit to a career in Data Analytics. I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Analytics Certification Program, where I immersed myself in learning the key tools and techniques essential for a data analyst role, including SQL (MySQL), Power BI, Python, and Advanced Excel. This journey sharpened my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, allowing me to transfer the skills I developed in previous roles to the world of data. Since then, Iâ€™ve enhanced my practical skills through a PwC (Switzerland) job simulation on Forage and a virtual internship at 360DigiTMG, where I worked on real-world projects to improve operational efficiency. These experiences allowed me to apply data analysis techniques to uncover key insights and optimize processes, further solidifying my passion for this field. Currently, Iâ€™m working on various projects to continue refining my data analytics skills and stay updated with industry best practices. Feel free to explore my repositories where I showcase my ongoing projects and progress as a Data Analyst. Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration!</h3>
